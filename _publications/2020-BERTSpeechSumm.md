* Adopt and contextualize the state-of-the-art BERT-based model for speech summarization.
* Explore the incorporation of confidence scores to see if such an attempt could help alleviate the negative effects caused by imperfect ASR.
* Augmented the sentence embeddings obtained from BERT with extra structural and linguistic features to boost the performance.
